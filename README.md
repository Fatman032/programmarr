> **This is a fork** of [Programmarr](https://github.com/jamesmattson/programmarr), kept by [@Fatman032](https://github.com/Fatman032), with extra fixes. Everything upstream does still works. What's different (full list in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)):
>
> - **Same-title items never get mixed up.** Every library is indexed by unique id, so remakes (two *Aladdin*s), a movie and a show with one name, and collection members all resolve to the right item. Saved entries can carry the item's ids, the Add box asks when several match, and the editor flags ambiguous plain titles with `[year] [year] [Both]` buttons.
> - **Nothing is skipped silently.** A title that can't be found is reported with the reason, on the channel list and in the editor.
> - **Live rules.** A channel can follow a genre, studio, director, actor or decade, asked of Plex again on every refresh, so a Live channel gains new matches on its own.
> - **Several commercial filler lists per channel,** and they now actually reach Tunarr when you Apply.
>
> Images: `ghcr.io/fatman032/programmarr:latest` is the latest release; every build is also tagged `sha-<short commit>` (pin one of those if you want a version that never moves). A **pre-release** (beta) is published on GitHub as a pre-release and tagged `:beta`; `:latest` only ever points at a normal release.

Programmarr is a self-hosted web app that turns your Plex library into a **curated lineup of themed virtual TV channels** in Tunarr — with a web UI that feels like Sonarr or Radarr.

You **compose** the lineup in a **Planner**: pick the genres, decades, studios, directors, and actors you want, check the exact channels from a live, counted list, and deploy. It's all deterministic — no AI required — with an **optional** AI layer that discovers themed channels your filters miss (Heist Films, Time Travel, Sports Underdogs) and splits broad pools by *tone* (Feel-Good vs Raunchy Comedies).

Channels can also be **self-maintaining**: mark one "live" and Programmarr re-checks it against your library on a schedule and patches it in place — new episodes and new franchise films appear on their own, no redeploy.

**Requires:** [Tunarr](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr) **1.x** + **Plex**

> **Plex only.** Programmarr reads your library metadata from the Plex API, so it needs a
> Plex-backed source in Tunarr. Jellyfin and Emby aren't supported yet — if a Tunarr has no
> Plex source, Programmarr will tell you so rather than failing mysteriously.
> Interested in Jellyfin support? Say so on
> [the tracking issue](https://github.com/AlpineArchitecture/programmarr/issues/36) — demand decides priority.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  programmarr:
    image: ghcr.io/fatman032/programmarr:latest
    container_name: programmarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7979:7979"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

### 2. Start it

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That's it — the image is pre-built on [GHCR](https://github.com/AlpineArchitecture/programmarr/pkgs/container/programmarr). No local build step needed, and nothing to clone.

### 3. Open the UI

```
http://<your-server-ip>:7979
```

First run shows an onboarding wizard — create a login, enter your Tunarr and Plex URLs, and hit
**Test connections** to confirm Programmarr can actually reach both before you go any further.

> **Heads up on your first deploy.** Programmarr's default deploy mode replaces the channels it
> manages. If you already have a hand-built Tunarr lineup, use **Add/Edit** mode rather than
> **Nuke**. Either way, Programmarr snapshots your existing lineup before deleting anything —
> see [Backups](#backups) below.

### TrueNAS

Paste this as a complete compose file in Apps → Custom App:

```yaml
services:
  programmarr:
    image: ghcr.io/fatman032/programmarr:latest
    container_name: programmarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7979:7979"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/YourPool/AppData/programmarr/data:/data
```

Replace `/mnt/YourPool/AppData/programmarr/data` with a real path on your pool.

---

## Updating

Programmarr only publishes a new image when a **version is released** — your container
never changes on its own. When a new release is out, the app shows an **"update available"**
banner in the top bar with a link to the release notes. Update when it suits you:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Your data (config, channels, library export) lives in the mounted `./data` volume and is
untouched by an update.

> Prefer hands-off? You can add [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) to
> auto-pull releases — see "Optional: automatic updates with Watchtower" below. Because
> images now publish only on releases, Watchtower will only ever pull *released versions*,
> never in-progress work.

## Optional: automatic updates with Watchtower

If you'd rather not think about updates at all, add Watchtower to your compose file. It
checks for a new image on the configured interval and restarts the container automatically
when one is available. Because Programmarr only publishes images on releases, Watchtower
will only ever pull released versions — never work-in-progress.

```yaml
services:
  programmarr:
    image: ghcr.io/fatman032/programmarr:latest
    container_name: programmarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7979:7979"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    container_name: watchtower
    environment:
      - DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.44
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    command: --interval 300 programmarr
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> **Note:** The `DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.44` env var is required on newer Docker engines (TrueNAS, Docker Desktop 4.x+). Without it, Watchtower crash-loops with "client version 1.25 is too old".

## The Planner

The heart of Programmarr. Instead of one mushy `Comedy (140)` channel, you build a lineup that feels **hand-programmed** — and you do it in a few clicks.

Pick which **genres and decades** are in play, and the Planner shows you a live, counted list of candidate channels. Check the ones you want:

| Candidate | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **TV Marathons** | A 24/7 channel for any show — *Cheers*, *The Office*, *It's Always Sunny* |
| **TV Blocks** | Themed multi-show channels — Comedy TV, Crime TV |
| **Genre × Decade** | Tight era cuts — *90s Comedy*, *80s Horror*, *2000s Action* |
| **Sub-genres** | Curated, named blends — *Rom-Coms*, *Dark Comedies*, *Crime Thrillers* |
| **Studios / Directors / Actors** | *A24*, *Directed by Tarantino*, *Adam Sandler Movies* |

Every section has **Top 10** and **Add all** for fast picking, and folds away once you've handled it. Hit **Build** and the channels are written instantly — no AI, no waiting.

### ✨ Optional: bring in AI

Flip one switch and an AI layer does the two things plain filters can't — seeded with the lineup you just built, and **merged on top** (it never duplicates what you have):

- **Discovery** — themed channels your filters miss: *Heist Films*, *Courtroom Dramas*, *Time Travel*, *Sports Underdogs*.
- **Tonal curation** — tap the ✨ on a broad pick and the AI splits it by *vibe*: *Feel-Good* vs *Raunchy* vs *Dark* Comedies — so one title flows into the next.

No API key needed — you copy a ready-made prompt into ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini and paste the result back.

### Then deploy

Setup → Export → Planner → (AI) → (Collections) → **Deploy**. The deploy step dry-runs first, lets you review and renumber, then pushes to Tunarr and syncs the Plex guide — all in one click, with live output streamed to the browser. **Plex collections** (Kometa, Trakt, Letterboxd) can be folded in as their own channels along the way.

---

## Live Channels (auto-updating)

Channels are normally static snapshots — you build them, deploy them, and they go stale as your library grows. **Mark a channel "live"** and Programmarr keeps it fresh for you: on a schedule it re-resolves the channel against your current library and patches it **in place**, only when something actually changed.

Two everyday patterns:

- **TV marathons** — a 24/7 single-show loop. New episodes land in Plex → they're on the channel by the next check.
- **Franchises** — add a *title-contains* rule (e.g. `Bad Boys`) in the channel editor. Every matching film is pulled in, in release order, and a new sequel joins automatically when it appears. A live preview shows exactly what matches before you save, and you can exclude any false positives.
- **Rules** — in the channel editor's Add box, choose **Genre**, **Studio**, **Director**, **Actor** or **Decade** (and Movies or TV shows), then pick the value from a list read from your Plex. Every refresh asks Plex for the current matches, so a new *Animation* movie joins an *Animation* channel on its own once Tunarr has scanned it in. If Plex can't be read, the channel is left exactly as it is. To convert an older channel, add the rule, click **Remove the N fixed titles**, then Save and Apply. (The Planner still saves a plain list of titles for now.)

**Why "in place" matters:** updates reuse the existing Tunarr channel — same channel number, same internal id — so Plex's Live TV / DVR mapping is never disturbed. No deleting, no re-adding the channel in Plex. An unchanged channel is a no-op, so there's no needless guide churn.

It ships **off**. Turn it on in **Settings → Live Channels**, flip the **"Auto-update"** switch on any channel you want maintained, and watch it from the **Dashboard → Auto-Updates** card (live count, last run, recent changes, pause, and a "Check now" button). Everything stays a recipe you can edit or revert at any time.

### Also included

- **Channel protection** — before deploying, choose which existing Tunarr channels to keep. Checked = preserved; unchecked = cleared and rebuilt as new stations. The "Channels start at" number auto-adjusts to leave room for whatever you keep.
- **Channel offset** — set a starting channel number so new channels don't collide with ones you want to keep. Auto-calculated from your highest protected channel, rounded to the nearest 10.
- **Library picker** — choose which Plex libraries to scan (Movies, 4K Movies, Kids TV, etc.) before each export; supports mixing multiple libraries of the same type
- **Channel logo fetching** — pulls TMDB clearlogos for single-show/movie channels
- **Plex DVR sync** — maps new channels into the Plex Live TV guide automatically
- **Channel editor** — edit names, numbers, shuffle mode, and content lists in the browser; an Add box with a type dropdown (Movie, TV Show, Collection, or a live Genre/Studio/Director/Actor/Decade rule); mark channels live and build franchise auto-match rules; see what each channel skipped and why
- **Optional basic auth** — set a username/password if you expose the UI outside your LAN

## Backups

Before Programmarr deletes any Tunarr channel, it writes a compressed snapshot of everything
it's about to remove — each channel plus its full programming — to your data directory:

```
data/tunarr_backup_20260819T195358Z.json.gz
```

On a 156-channel server that's about 12 MB and takes ~20 seconds. The **3 most recent** are
kept; older ones are removed automatically. Probe/dry runs never write one.

**This is a safety net, not a feature** — there's no restore button yet. If you need to go
back, the file is plain JSON once unzipped, containing everything Tunarr's API needs:

```bash
gunzip -c data/tunarr_backup_20260819T195358Z.json.gz > lineup.json
```

Each entry has the original `channel` object (including its Tunarr `id`) and the raw
`programming` payload. If you ever need to recover a lineup, open an
[issue](https://github.com/AlpineArchitecture/programmarr/issues) with that file's structure
and I'll help — and if it happens to anyone, a proper restore command moves to the top of the list.

## Configuration

Everything is set through the UI. Config is stored in `./data/config.json` (bind-mounted, never baked into the image).

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Tunarr URL | Yes | e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8000` |
| Plex URL | Yes | e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:32400` |
| Plex Token | Yes | [How to find yours](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/) |
| TMDB API Key | No | Free at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) — only needed for channel logos |

### Advanced Configuration

These optional keys can be added directly to `config.json` (they're not in the UI). Most setups don't need them, and they're safe to leave out — Tunarr's defaults apply. They survive UI saves.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `tunarr_channel_group` | `tunarr` | Group/folder all generated channels are assigned to in Tunarr |
| `tunarr_stream_mode` | `hls` | Streaming mode for generated channels. One of `hls`, `hls_slower`, `mpegts`, `hls_direct`, `hls_direct_v2` |

### Channel Numbering

Channels are numbered **sequentially from 1**, tight-packed in category order — no fixed block
sizes, no gaps. Categories run in this order: TV Marathons → TV Blocks → TV & Movie Mix → Movie
Channels → Studios/Directors/Actors → Networks → Classic TV Blocks → Franchise & Series →
Specialty. Empty categories consume no numbers. **Settings → Channel Numbering** lets you drag
the categories into whatever order you prefer. Numbering on a fresh deploy starts at channel
**1**; keeping existing channels shifts new ones above the highest you kept. (Stored as
`channel_order`, a list of category keys, in `config.json` — omit it for the default order.)

### Commercials

Any channel can play commercials in the gaps between shows. In Tunarr, create a **filler list** of commercial/bumper clips (a [Plex "Other Videos" library](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200265256-adding-content-to-plex/) works well). Then in Programmarr, open a channel → **Commercials** → turn it on and pick one list or several (they're mixed evenly). Save and Apply attaches the lists in Tunarr, and the channel plays a short ad break between each show.

---

## CLI (advanced)

If you prefer the terminal, everything the web app does is available from the command line — no
Docker, no extra server. The Python scripts have zero dependencies beyond the standard library.

```bash
python programmarr.py
```

**→ Full walkthrough: [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md)** — the interactive menu, calling the raw
scripts directly (cron-friendly), and editing `config.json` by hand for advanced keys like
`tunarr_stream_mode` and `tunarr_channel_group`.
