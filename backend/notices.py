"""Per-channel notices: what a channel's last resolve could not find, and what it found
again through a backup number.

Without this a title that no longer matches simply vanishes from the channel and nobody is
told. Kept in its own small file, not in channels.json — that file is the person's own
data, and a notice is a transient report about it. Every write is best-effort: a notice is
information, so failing to save one must never fail a deploy.
