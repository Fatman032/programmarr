Pure, importable building blocks shared by create.py (CLI deploy), the live-channel

tunarr_url / plex_url / token — nothing here reads config.json or touches argv, so

    """Classify channels for a surgical diff deploy (Add/Edit mode).

    Pure function — no Tunarr or file I/O; fully unit-testable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    desired       : list of channel dicts from channels.draft.json (the planner's output).
    deployed      : list of channel dicts from channels.json (the currently-deployed managed set).
    prior_managed : set of lowercased channel names the planner built/deployed last time
                    (from ``planner_state.json["managed_names"]``).  When ``None`` or empty,
                    defaults to an empty set — no channels are deleted (safe, conservative
                    bootstrapping behaviour for installs that have no planner history yet).

    Returns a dict with five keys:
        create    — channels in desired but NOT in deployed (by name, case-insensitive).
        delete    — channels in deployed, absent from desired, AND whose name is in
                    ``prior_managed`` (i.e. the planner previously owned them and the user
                    intentionally removed them).
        update    — channels in both desired and deployed whose content, shuffle, or live
                    flag differs.  A ``live`` channel whose content changed always lands here
                    (update-in-place) — its Tunarr id is preserved.
        unchanged — channels present in both sets where nothing changed.
        foreign   — channels in deployed, absent from desired, whose name is NOT in
                    ``prior_managed``.  These are hand-authored channels (created outside
                    the planner) and are NEVER touched — not deleted, not created, not
                    updated.

    Identity = channel name (case-insensitive, stripped).  Names are deterministic
    in the Planner, so they are a stable key.

    Invariant enforcement (HARD — never relaxed):
    1. The ``delete`` bucket only ever contains planner-managed channels (prior_managed).
       Hand-authored / foreign channels land in ``foreign`` and are never auto-deleted.
    2. A ``live`` channel in the ``update`` bucket is always patched in place (never
       delete-and-recreated) — the caller's update loop preserves the Tunarr id and
       Plex DVR mapping.  A planner-managed live channel that the user explicitly removes
       (absent from desired, name in prior_managed) IS eligible for deletion — removing a
       channel from the planner is an intentional act and does not violate invariant 2
       (delete-RECREATE is what's forbidden; a plain delete is fine).
    3. Orphan channels (those in Tunarr but absent from channels.json) are not part of
       either input list and therefore cannot appear in any output bucket.
